A gallery plugin for OctoberCMS that tries to Keep It Simple and Stupid.

 1. Upload your images using the Media Manager built into OctoberCMS
 2. Drop November Gallery onto your page or partial
 3. Select the folder you uploaded your images to and how you want them displayed

Behind the scenes, November Gallery makes use of the [Image Resizer plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/toughdeveloper-imageresizer) to generate thumbnails of your images, and the excellent [UniteGallery jQuery Gallery Plugin](https://github.com/vvvmax/unitegallery). The plugin reads images uploaded using October\'s built-in Media manager, uses the ImageResizer plugin to automatically generate thumbnails, and presents them in a gallery either as tiles (arranged in columns, justified, or laid out in a grid), as a carousel, as a slider, or as a pop-up lightbox that can be opened from a link/button. Some of its awesome features: responsive/touch enabled/skinnable/themable/gallery buttons/keyboard control etc.
