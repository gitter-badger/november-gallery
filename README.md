A gallery plugin for OctoberCMS that tries to Keep It Simple and Stupid.

 1. Upload your images using the Media Manager built into OctoberCMS
 2. Drop November Gallery onto your page or partial
 3. Select the folder you uploaded your images to and how you want them displayed

Behind the scenes, November Gallery makes use of the [Image Resizer plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/toughdeveloper-imageresizer) to generate thumbnails of your images, and the excellent [UniteGallery jQuery Gallery Plugin](https://github.com/vvvmax/unitegallery). 
## Fetaures:
- Three components included: 
	 - Embedded Gallery if you wish to show a gallery of images in your page
	 - Popup Lightbox for galleries that can be opened from a link or button on your page
	 - Image List Only if you want to handle the display of the images yourself
 - Various options for the Embedded Gallery that can be configured in the back-end without writing a line of code: 
	 - tiles (arranged in columns, justified, or laid out in a grid)
	 - carousel
	 - slider
	 - combined (large image + lightbox)
	 - video
 - Set which folder of images to display in the component configuration panel OR pass it dynamically as a page-variable
 - Responsive/touch enabled/skinnable/themable/gallery buttons/keyboard control etc.
 ### Limitations / ToDo:
 - Support titles & captions
 - Test embedding & linking video
 - Get the demo page up and running
 - Extensive help docs
## Deployment
### Requirements
If you want the plugin to inject the required scripts and CSS, you must have a `{styles}` tag in the head section of your page or layout: 
```html
<head>
    ...
    {% styles %}
</head>
```
as well as a `{scripts}` tag in the body section:
```html
<body>
    ...
    {% scripts %}
</body>
```
For more information see the [OctoberCMS docs](https://octobercms.com/docs/cms/pages#injecting-assets)!
