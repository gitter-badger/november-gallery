A gallery plugin for OctoberCMS that tries to Keep It Simple and Stupid.

 1. Upload your images using the Media Manager built into OctoberCMS
 2. Drop November Gallery onto your page or partial
 3. Select the folder you uploaded your images to and how you want them displayed

Behind the scenes, November Gallery makes use of the [Image Resizer plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/toughdeveloper-imageresizer) to generate thumbnails of your images, and the excellent [UniteGallery jQuery Gallery Plugin](https://github.com/vvvmax/unitegallery). 
### Fetaures
 - Three components included: 
	 - Embedded Gallery if you wish to show a gallery of images in your page
	 - Popup Lightbox for galleries that can be opened from a link or button on your page
	 - 
 - Various gallery options that can be configured in the back-end without writing a line of code: 
	 - tiles (arranged in columns, justified, or laid out in a grid)
	 - carousel
	 - slider
	 - pop-up lightbox that can be opened from a link/button
 - Set which folder of images to display in the component configuration panel OR pass it dynamically as a page-variable
 - Responsive/touch enabled/skinnable/themable/gallery buttons/keyboard control etc.
