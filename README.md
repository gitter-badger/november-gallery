OctoberCMS Media manager + vvvmax/unitegallery + Image Resizer plugin = a highly customizable yet reliable way to display your photos in a gallery. The plugin reads images uploaded using October\'s built-in Media manager, uses the ImageResizer plugin to automatically generate thumbnails, and presents them in a gallery either as tiles (arranged in columns, justified, or laid out in a grid), as a carousel, as a slider, or as a pop-up lightbox that can be opened from a link/button. Some of its awesome features: responsive/touch enabled/skinnable/themable/gallery buttons/keyboard control etc.
