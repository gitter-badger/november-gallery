A gallery plugin for OctoberCMS that tries to Keep It Simple and Stupid.

 1. Upload your images using the Media Manager built into OctoberCMS
 2. Drop November Gallery onto your page or partial
 3. Select the folder you uploaded your images to and how you want them displayed

Behind the scenes, November Gallery makes use of the [Image Resizer plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/toughdeveloper-imageresizer) to generate thumbnails of your images, and the excellent [UniteGallery jQuery Gallery Plugin](https://github.com/vvvmax/unitegallery).
